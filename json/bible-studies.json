        "description": "Our corporate worship gathering takes place every Sunday at 10:30am. This time is special because it is the only time during the week that our whole congregation is gathered together under one roof. It is a time devoted to the worship of Christ through the singing of traditional and modern hymns and spiritual songs. We gain courage and equipping to live out our faith as we hear the Word of God preached. We also give special attention to prayer each week, and we observe the Lord's Supper on the first Sunday of each month.",
