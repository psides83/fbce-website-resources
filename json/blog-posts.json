Here is the heart of Christmas, the heart of Scripture, the heart of redemptive history: Jesus came to save his people from their sins. His very name means “to save.” Remember the promise back in Genesis 3:15? God was pronouncing a curse on the serpent because he had deceived Adam and Eve into rebelling against God. Yet, embedded in this curse was the promise that the “seed of the woman” would come and crush the head of the serpent. It’s clear that the offspring himself would sustain injury because the LORD also said that the serpent would “bruise his heel.”",

He accomplished this not by coming in brute strength but in humility and weakness. Through his death, Jesus paid the penalty for sin and stripped sin of its power over us. “He was pierced for our wrongdoing; he was crushed for our evil desires; upon him was the punishment that brought us peace, and by his wounds we are saved.” And all this was God’s plan from the beginning",

We have been delivered from God’s just punishment toward our sin. Jesus’ perfect obedience to the Father qualifies him to make full payment for our sin. His resurrection and ascension is the Father’s stamp of approval to show that Jesus’ death was truly enough to cover our sins (past, present, and future). As someone has said, we have been saved from sin’s penalty; we are being saved from sin’s power; and one day we will be saved from sin’s presence.

In fact, what it meant to be a “son of David” was not merely to be his descendant but to rule in the fear of the Lord the way that David did. In 2 Samuel 7:16, God promised King David, “And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.” How could this be? How would David’s rule last forever? Only through his greater Son. Christ is the fulfillment of God’s promise to King David. The Scripture is clear that David’s righteous rule was always pointing forward to a coming King who would rule perfectly and permanently",

Unfortunately, it's much worse because it’s a true story, and it reflects the real-life situations that happen when people choose sin and self rather than to fear the LORD and trust his plan. In the ancient Near East, when a young woman’s husband died it was understood that the deceased’s brother (or next closest male relative) would redeem her by taking her as his wife. This provided support for the widow and ensured that the family tree would persist. This, coupled with God’s command to Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to “be fruitful and multiply,” shows just how defiant Judah was being when he failed to give his youngest son to Tamar. We might think her way of getting back at Judah was perverse. While the Bible does not condone Tamar’s actions, the narrative is clearly meant to shame Judah for not trusting God’s plan and to show God’s faithfulness to work out his plan despite the crooked actions of those he uses."

When the apostle John writes that “the Word became flesh and dwelt among us,” the word he uses for “dwelt” is the same Greek word for tabernacle. This is no coincidence.

But this is where the promise of Christ begins. Right there in the garden, in the midst of pronouncing a curse on the Serpent, God simultaneously promised a Savior who would crush the Serpent’s head. And this Savior would be born of a woman. The language that God used would become unmistakeable; the Savior will be born of a virgin. The word used for “offspring” in Genesis 3:15 is the word for “seed.” Women do not have seed; men do. Yet, God says that the seed of the woman will crush the head of the Serpent. The answer to Adam and Eve’s rebellion against God (and all the rebellion since) would come through a chosen descendant."

Lewis famously said in his well-known book Mere Christianity, “If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.” Advent is about waiting; it’s about longing; it’s about groaning. It’s about remembering that we were made to be satisfied in Christ alone. All our longings ultimately point to this reality. And we have the certainty that all our groaning will end because the One in whom we find the fullest satisfaction left his throne in Heaven, took on flesh, died for our sins, and rose to conquer death itself. We can groan with joy because Jesus has secured a future for those who love him and long for his return. It is a future that is beyond all comprehension or comparison. It is the forever for which we were made!",

Some probably chose to die rather than go to such a place. And if the famine wasn’t bad enough, Naomi lost her husband and two sons and was left with no male descendants to carry on the family name or secure a future inheritance. In the ancient world, the thought of your family dying out was unacceptable. There was little-to-no thought given to individual identity. Your family name, as well as the material and spiritual inheritance that was handed down from generation to generation, was integral to the very identity of every person. When Naomi lost her sons, in a very real way she and any hope of her family persisting died with them. Yet, this was all part of God’s redemptive plan.",

Under normal circumstances, Elimelech would never have taken his family to Moab and Naomi’s sons would never have taken foreign wives. But here we see the beauty of God’s providence!
