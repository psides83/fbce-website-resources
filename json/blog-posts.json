Our ethnic and familial heritage is part of who we are, but it is not the whole of who we are meant to be.

In 2 Samuel 7:16, God promised King David, “And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.” How could this be? How would David’s rule last forever? Only through his greater Son. Christ is the fulfillment of God’s promise to King David.

Unfortunately, it's much worse because it’s a true story, and it reflects the real-life situations that happen when people choose sin and self rather than to fear the LORD and trust his plan. In the ancient Near East, when a young woman’s husband died it was understood that the deceased’s brother (or next closest male relative) would redeem her by taking her as his wife. This provided support for the widow and ensured that the family tree would persist. This, coupled with God’s command to Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to “be fruitful and multiply,” shows just how defiant Judah was being when he failed to give his youngest son to Tamar. We might think her way of getting back at Judah was perverse. While the Bible does not condone Tamar’s actions, the narrative is clearly meant to shame Judah for not trusting God’s plan and to show God’s faithfulness to work out his plan despite the crooked actions of those he uses."

The human authors of Scripture never try to cover up the drama. All the “dirty laundry” is out there for everyone to see, and God intended it to be this way. It was through the mess of Judah’s family drama that God would bring the royal line of King David. When Jacob blessed his 12 sons before his death, Judah received the most significant promise.
