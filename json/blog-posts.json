The traditional word for this season is actually Advent, and it means “coming.” Historically, Christians have observed the Advent season by celebrating not only  Christ’s first coming but also anticipating his second coming. So, to truly experience the meaning of Christmas is to remember how and why Jesus came in the flesh and to reflect on his promises to return."

This can be disappointing if we don’t come from an “ideal” family situation (whatever that looks like). It can also be a dangerous source of pride for us if we put too much emphasis on our background. Our ethnic and familial heritage is part of who we are, but it is not the whole of who we are meant to be. Regardless of your earthly heritage, the history recorded in Matthew chapter one is important for you. This is your ancestry, your story, if you are in Christ. So read it as if it is your own family history! And if you are not yet united to Christ, this can become your story through faith in him."
