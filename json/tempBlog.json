The tiny nation of Israel never knew such blessing, security, and prominence as when David was king. David even became the very standard by which all other kings in Israel were measured because only under David did Israel rightly worship the LORD. In fact, what it meant to be a “son of David” was not merely to be his descendant but to rule in the fear of the Lord the way that David did. In 2 Samuel 7:16, God promised King David, “And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever.” How could this be? How would David’s rule last forever? Only through his greater Son. Christ is the fulfillment of God’s promise to King David. The Scripture is clear that David’s righteous rule was always pointing forward to a coming King who would rule perfectly and permanently.",

But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man but of God.\"",

No matter our circumstances this Advent season, we can celebrate with joy and hope, knowing that the hero we need has already come! And because he came the first time to redeem his fallen creation, we can trust that he will come again to restore it fully and finally!"
